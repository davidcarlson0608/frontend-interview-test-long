ONTRAPORT Front-end Evaluation, Long Test
============================

A note about my project: 

While testing this code, please use Firefox. 
It is the only browser that allows Same Origin Policy by default. 
This is necessary to allow for json to be read from within the file system. 

Also, I noticed an error in the users.json file.
The fourth user, Juan Sanchez Villalobos Ramirez has the incorrect img URL.


My Project Timeline:

Documentation reading & File exploration - 30 mins

Nav bar replication (CSS): 20 mins

Search bar white shadow & button styling (CSS): 15 mins

2 column layout and first column content (CSS & HTML): 30  mins

Load JSON files to output posts (JS): 1hr

Load JSON files to output comments & add comment bar (JS): 40mins

Style posts, comments, profile pics, and comment bar (Also some minor CSS adjustments) (CSS): 1.5hrs

Style footer (CSS): 5mins

Create modal for post update (CSS): 45mins

Added modal functionality for posting (JS): 35mins

NOTE: The above time is what it took me to create the current modal implementation (no framework).
Before I created this, I wasted ~45mins - 1hr with JQuery UI's dialog widget, but I did not like the styling and my implementation of it was buggy sometimes.
Therefore I scrapped it and used native CSS & Standard JQuery JS to create my own modal. (so +1hr)

EXTRA CREDIT:

Comment submission (JS): 30mins

box.js experimentation for understanding: 20 mins

localstorage implementation: 1hr

CSS reorganization, and comments/documentation in code: ~45mins total (done between phase completions)


Thoughts on project:
While some parts were more challenging than others, overall the requirements were pretty straight forward.
I enjoyed the project, and definitely learned a thing or two along the way.
This has reminded me that I need to work on my CSS a bit more, because it took me longer than I had expected for certain things.

Total time for required sections: 370mins (~6hrs) 

Time wasted on JQuery UI Dialog: 60 mins (1hr)

Total time for extra credit work: 110mins (~1.9hrs)

Total time for documentation/cleanup: 45mins (across the project)

Total time spent: 585mins (9.75hrs)

Thanks for reading! :]
